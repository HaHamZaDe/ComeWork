# ComeWork

This **React Native** application is a powerful job listing app that enables users to explore a wide range of job opportunities, save their favorite job listings, and view detailed job descriptions. With seamless navigation and intuitive design, job seekers can effortlessly browse through various job listings, learn more about the roles they are interested in, and even submit job applications directly through the app. The app also includes a "Favorites" feature, allowing users to keep track of their preferred job opportunities.
