# ComeWork
The project "KodWork" in the React Native Mobile App Path available on "[https://academy.patika.dev/](https://academy.patika.dev/tr/paths/react-native-ile-mobile-app-patikasi)" .

* The application is implemented using **React Native**.
* **Axios** is utilized to retrieve product information from "[https://www.themuse.com/developers/api/v2](https://www.themuse.com/developers/api/v2)". 
* Additionally, I took advantage of the **Lottie** component to create loading and error animations.
* **React-Navigation** has been employed to manage the stack and drawer structure of the mobile app.
* **React-Redux** has been implemented to handle global variables while creating favorite jobs.
